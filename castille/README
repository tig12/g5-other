Data in the sub-directories were sent by Didier Castille, who gave
the authorization to put these data available online.

Didier Castille was working at INSEE (Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques), the national French institute of statistics. Having access to INSEE data, he conducted statistical tests with millions of dates, studying in particular sun - sun relationships between wife and husband.

Didier Castille agreed to make these data publicly available but he wants to
stress the following points:
- These files are not INSEE files, they are INSEE files adapted by D. Castille.
- These files are neither official nor scientifically valid because they depend
  on the good faith of D. Castille.
