Data coming from Didier Castille

Didier Castille spent his career at INSEE (Institut National de la Statistique
et des Etudes Economiques, the national French institute of statistics) and had
access to the data of INSEE.

Didier Castille agreed to make these data publicly available but he wants to
stress the following points:
- These files are not INSEE files, they are INSEE files adapted by D. Castille.
- These files are neither official nor scientifically valid because they depend
  on the good faith of D. Castille.
